            What Was the Emergency Broadband Benefit?
          </h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            The Emergency Broadband Benefit launched in May 2021 as a temporary pandemic response, providing up to $50 monthly internet discounts and device subsidies. This program helped millions of families stay online during challenging times, but it was designed as short-term relief with limited funding.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            EBB participants received monthly credits on their internet bills and could purchase tablets or computers for just $10-$50. The program operated through participating internet providers nationwide, making high-speed internet accessible to households that previously couldn't afford it.

            The Transition to Better Programs
          </h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            In December 2021, the Emergency Broadband Benefit evolved into the Affordable Connectivity Program, offering more stable funding and expanded eligibility. Existing EBB participants automatically transitioned to ACP without losing their benefits, while new applicants gained access to improved services.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            The ACP provides up to $30 monthly for internet service (up to $75 on tribal lands) and one-time device discounts up to $100. This represents a more sustainable approach to digital equity, with dedicated federal funding designed to last for years rather than months.
          </p>
          <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 p-4 mb-4" style="border-left-color: var(--color-primary)">
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              <strong>Important Update:</strong> While ACP ended in 2024 due to funding exhaustion, Lifeline continues providing free phone service with data. Many providers now bundle <strong>{keyword}</strong> packages that combine Lifeline benefits with their own subsidized internet offerings.
